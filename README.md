# Low to High Level Assembler

This is a second-stage assembler for testing programs on the LTHL CPU.

It is not a complete system, but it can manage a few basic tasks.

## Features that this assembler has:
 - Direct instruction to machine code
 - Extensions (no functional ones on the emulator until episode 9).

## Features that are missing:
 - Support for psuedoinstructions
 - Support for Labels

Most likely I will ignore adding these features in favor of supporting a full assembler like GNU's binutils.

That will be a lot more useful in the long run, especially for debugging, and future compiler support.
